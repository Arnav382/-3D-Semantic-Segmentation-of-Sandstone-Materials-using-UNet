# -3D-Semantic-Segmentation-of-Sandstone-Materials-using-UNet
Advanced 3D semantic segmentation model to classify four distinct materials(air, quartz, pyrite, clay) present in sandstone, based on tomography scan data.
Leveraging the powerful UNet

architecture with VGG16 as the backbone and pre-trained on ImageNet, the model showcased exceptional performance.

Trained the model on a dataset of tomography scans to classify four materials in sandstone. 
Utilized encoder weights pre-trained on ImageNet to enhance model accuracy and generalization. 

Achieved an impressive IOU score of 0.70 and an F1-score of 0.81 on the training set
